This session covers the new features in Docker Engine 1.7.0. We conclude with a
live migration demo of an ioquake3 server all around the world without
interrupting the players (running ioquake3 client in a container themselves).

Co-presented with <a href="https://twitter.com/crosbymichael">Michael
Crosby</a>, Docker core maintainer and Software Engineer in Docker Engine team.
