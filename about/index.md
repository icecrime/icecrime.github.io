## #MyLife

I was born in Paris, where I studied computer science at <a
href="http://www.epitech.eu">Epitech</a>.

I spent most of my carreer working as software engineer and engineering manager
in banking, until I had the amazing opportunity to relocate in the Bay Area and
work for <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>.
